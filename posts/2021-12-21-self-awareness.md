> “Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” - Aristotle

Questions I'm answering to reflect and plan for the coming year.

1. How have I grown this year? What experiences/system led to this type of growth?
2. What challenges did I face this year? What did I learn from them?
3. What are 10 things this year that I feel truly grateful for?
4. What made me feel purposeful this last year?
5. What do I want to bring into the next year? What do I want to let go of?

Happy new year!
