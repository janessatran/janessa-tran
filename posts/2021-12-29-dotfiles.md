Setting up a new development environment can be a time consuming thing, but it doesn't have to be! That's where dotfiles come in.

**Dotfiles** are essentially files that are used to customize your system, and they are named as such because the configuration files often start with a dot (you know, like `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc).

I'm storing my [dotfiles here](https://github.com/janessatran/dotfiles). At the moment, I just copy or symlink them to existing config files, but you can get real fancy and create an installation script if you want.

A **symlink** is a symbolic link that creates a shortcut to another file. So let's say I installed this `dotfiles` repo on a new computer and wanted to link the config files to my current config files (usually in the home directory, `~`). I would do something like:

```bash
ln -sv "~/.dotfiles/git/.gitconfig" ~
ln -sv "~/.dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc" ~
```

Boom! dotfiles setup ðŸŒŸ
