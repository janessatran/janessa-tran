Hi! I'm Janessa. I'm a first-generation college graduate, a data analyst turned software engineer, and a lover of art and creativity. Currently I work at <a href="https://www.adobe.com/corporate-responsibility/creativity-for-all.html" target="_blank">Adobe</a>, where I build tools to help people bring their creative visions to life.

I'm interested in a multitude of things and I let me curiousity and values drive my direction. **I value creativity, empathy, respect, integrity, and health above all else.**

If you're interested in collaborating on a technical project or commissioning artwork, you can reach me on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/byjanessa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@byjanessa</a> or message me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/janessatran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>.
