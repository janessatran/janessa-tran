I'm a software engineer at Adobe, building things that are both functional and imaginative. I love to learn, create, and explore the spaces where technology and art intersect. My curiosity drives me to continually evolve— whether it's through my work as a developer, my fascination with psychology, or my ongoing pursuit of artistic expression.

I didn't start out as a coder. My journey began with a degree in economics, but my thirst for knowledge led me down unexpected paths. I dove into the world of programming through the 100 Days of Code challenge, and along the way, I discovered my passion for coding.

Outside of work, I'm equally curious about the world of art. I'm drawn to detail, texture, and the way creativity can shape our understanding of the world. Art, for me, is not just about aesthetics- it’s a powerful tool for emotional expression and self-discovery. I also believe in the therapeutic potential of art. Whether through creating or experiencing it, art helps process emotions, confront challenges, and foster healing. It offers a nonverbal space for reflection, making it a unique path for both personal growth and emotional clarity.

My experiences, both personal and professional, inspire the way I see the world and the things I create. I'm also a huge believer in the importance of balance: I love to be active, play, and move, but I also value stillness and reflection. Whether I'm exploring the technical side of things or diving into something more artistic, I'm always learning, always creating, and always curious.
